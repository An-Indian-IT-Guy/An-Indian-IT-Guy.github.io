# **About Me**

Hi I am **Rinu Varghese** a.k.a **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
  I am a [Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect](https://www.credly.com/badges/b25632ce-268d-4712-b0dd-cf1743008d70) with more than ten years of experience in the IT industry. I also have knowledge of Infrastructure as Code. Apart from work, I enjoy taking long motorcycle rides on my [Hero Xpulse 200 4V](https://www.heromotocorp.com/en-in/motorcycles/performance/xpulse-200-4v.html), a lite Offroader turned tourer. I also enjoy making food to satisfy my cravings for [homemade dishes](./recipes.html).<br><br>
